## Presentations

Lately I've been using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) a lot for my presentations. This repository collects those presentations and serves them via my [GitHub Pages](http://mguenther.github.io/presentations).

Shoutouts to [Cynthia Ng](https://cynng.wordpress.com/). I shamelessly borrowed this approach from your excellent blog post on [Using Reveal.JS on GitHub Pages](https://cynng.wordpress.com/2014/10/08/using-reveal-js-on-github-pages-for-your-presentations/). Thank you!
